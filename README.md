Repository of presets I've created in Bitwig Studio 4.x or later.

## DIN Sync Grid v1.0

Usage:
---------
Set the CV outs to ES8 ports for example, then to Pam's and Metron. 
Pam's Run = Y, 24ppqn
Metron Reset = Snc, 24ppqn

Key points:
--------------
- grid is set to quarter note phase cycles
- scale is set to 24:1 for 24 pulses per quarter note
- OR gate ensures clock is low when stopped/paused
- AND gate ensures Run is high when playing or paused (non-zero phase)
